RoboARM utilizes a TM4C123GH6PM microcontroller to interpret inputs from an old analog joystick to control the servos that drive the arm; while at the same time making sure that the arm abides by the set movement bounds of the hardware. The microcontroller implements the added functionality of being able to record, store, and ultimately repeat routines that the operator performs.
